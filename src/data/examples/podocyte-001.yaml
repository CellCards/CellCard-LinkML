name: podocyte
title: Podocyte (CL_0000653)
description: >-
  Podocyte is a cell type in renal corpuscle and wraps around the capillary of the glomerulus in the kidney. Renal corpuscle filters the blood, retaining large molecules such as proteins and filtering out smaller molecules such as water, salts, and sugars in the formation of urine. Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells that reside in the visceral layer of the Bowman's capsule.

    Above is a graphic (prepared by: Alex Diehl) of CL hierarchy of podocyte and its associated cell types represented in the CL. Later on we will show a cell hierarchy with live links to other cell types.
anatomical_location: |-
  Podocyte wraps around the capillary of the glomerulus in the kidney.
    'part of' some 'visceral layer of glomerular capsule' (UBERON_0005751)
connections_and_vicinity: |-
  Podocytes are neighbors of many other cell types such as afferent and efferent arteriole endothelial cells, mesangial cell, etc.

lineage: >-
  The kidney, including the kidney epithelial cells, arises from OSR1+ mesenchymal progenitor cells in the intermediate mesoderm. 
  As a type of kidney epithelial cells, podocytes arise from cap mesenchyme progenitor cells and require activation of SIX2, PAX2 and WT1. Ref: Shankland et al., 2014.
