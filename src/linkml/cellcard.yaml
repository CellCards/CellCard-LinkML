    description: >-
      An abstract holder for any set of metadata and data. It does not need to correspond to an actual managed database
      top level holder class. When translated to JSON-Schema this is the 'root' object.
      It should contain pointers to other objects of interest

    description:
      Applies to a property that links a database object to a set of objects.
      This is necessary in a json document to provide context for a list, and
      to allow for a single json object that combines multiple object types

    multivalued: true
    description: >-
      This property links a database object to the set of cell cards within it.
